SERVER APPLICATION
Nodejs is required with espress, multer, body parser and mongodb.
(npm install express, nmp install multer, npm install body-parser, npm install mongodb)

It's possible to run the server application just entering in src_server and running node index.js

!!!NOTE: THE CONNECTION TO MONGOLAB DOESN'T WORK IN THE UNIVERSITY NETWORK!!!!

MOBILE APPLICATION
All the code is written in the index.js file, placed in src_mobile/index.js

The project has been already built, and the apk is placed in src_mobile/bin/iBeacons.apk
this app has been built for android 4.4.4 and 4.4.2

in mobile_src/doc is possible to see the documentation used for the beacons detection.

mobile_src isn't the hole project folder, it contains only the index.js (where we wrote the code) and the already built apk!
It was too big to upload the entire folder.
